<p>Cook and stir ground beef in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain fat. Stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.
</p>
<p>Stack two sheets phyllo dough on a work surface. Spoon 1/8 of the beef mixture down one long edge of the stack,
     then roll phyllo around filling into a tube.
      Coil the tube into a snail shape and place onto an ungreased baking 
      sheet. Repeat to make seven more burek, placing finished coils up against one another to keep them from unrolling. Brush melted butter over the tops.

  Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal! This is a really easy lasagna recipe.

  Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.
  Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.
  Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
  Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.

<p class="ing" >Ingredients</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none" style="padding-left: 0px;" >
  <li>1 cup of milk</li>
  <li>Feta cheese</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In a medium saucepan, bring the water, oil, milk, salt, and butter to a boil on medium heat.
    While the water is boiling, cut up the bread or use your hands to break it apart. I like to cut it a bit larger than bite size because it will cook down quite a bit and I like some pieces to be larger.
